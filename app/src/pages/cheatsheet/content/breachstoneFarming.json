        "`Gatekeepers` will increase the value of `Within Their Grasp` by increasing the chances to spawn bosses but also will double the splinters dropped by these bosses, which will amount to quite a bit of splinters overtime and many additional breachstones as well. The nodes leading up to it are however pretty much entirely wasted since we guarantee the Breachlord via the sextant mentioned earlier. Simply grab Uul-Nethol on the way.",
